# Building a new project

This base repo collects common code and information shared between all projects. To use it, you need to build a specific one. To do that, first create a new repository and clone it to your own machine. There isn't a README.md file in this repository, so you can add that to the project repo, but you should not add a .gitignore, as that should come from the build-specific mixin.
